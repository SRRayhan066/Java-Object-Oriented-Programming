Q. Why java is platform independent?
Ans: In one sentence, Java is dependent on platform middleware(JVM) rather than OS.

Generally, After execution of a code, a .exe file is created by the compiler. If the language is not Java and the .exe file is created in
WINDOWS, then it will not run on the UNIX operating system even if the machine is the same. Same with the UNIX operating system. Because
the communication path of an application is,

    Application -> Operating System -> Hardware.

To run an application, it is mandatory to match the OS.

In Java, there is a platform middleware called JVM. For different types of operating systems, different types of JVM is available.
A Java application is dependent on JVM and JVM connects the application with OS. The path for Java applications is,

    Application -> Platform Middleware(JVM) -> Operating System -> Hardware

So if a Java program has compiled in WINDOWS, and needs to run in the UNIX operating system then the JVM that exists in that machine will
modify the machine code according to the OS.

And this is how Java becomes platform independent.
